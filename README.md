# jDataAnalysis - Data Analysis with Java

## What is it?
The project **jDataAnalysis** is about a series of design studies carried out
in a JavaFX environment. It deals with how to plot experimental data using Java
together with third party libraries. This project is divided into two parts. 
While the first part contains classes that rely on the JavaFX chart package including [ExtJFX](https://github.com/extjfx/extjfx)
to display animated charts.
However, the second part sticks to the third party library [HanSolo](https://github.com/HanSolo/charts)
to plot the data.

## System Requirements
**JDK**:
* The project has been tested with JDK 21.0.2. Both the Java compiler and Java runtime (JRE) need to 
support 64-bit. Compatible Java compilers as well as JREs can be 
downloaded from [Bellsoft](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/).

**pHCalc**
* This program generates the test data for the titration curves. You can download
a jar file from this [link](https://github.com/amxyz-cyber/pHCalc).

## Compiling jDataAnalysis
If you decide to compile this project then you can do it with [maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
Under Linux open a terminal and go to the directory of this project. 
Then run the following command which will compile the source files:
```bash
$ mvn clean package
```

After a successful compilation the `.jar` file together with the 
libraries will be placed in the subfolder called `target`.

## Installing jDataAnalysis
If you want to use the provided binaries, i.e. the release package
instead, then the installation process is simple:

1. Unpack the archive where you would like to store the binaries, e.g.:
* Unix-based operating systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)
	```bash
	$ tar zxvf charts_animated-x.y.z.tar.gz
	```
* Windows
	```bash
	unzip charts_animated-x.y.z.zip
	```
2. A directory called "charts_animated-x.y.z" will be created.

## Starting jDataAnalysis
* Unix-based operating systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)
	```bash
	$ java -jar charts_animated-x.y.z.jar
	```
* Windows
> Right-click on `charts_animated-x.y.z.exe` > **Open**.

## Usage
Basically, this program allows for the creation of one plot at a time. In order
to select a plot, just uncomment the call to one of the methods beginning with `test`
in `App.java`. Afterwards, you can compile the project and restart `jDataAnalysis` .
Alternatively, just import the whole project into your IDE, in which you basically 
uncomment one of the test methods. To execute the project in your IDE, you 
need to select the file containing the main method and hit the play button.

## Plots
### First Part contains animated charts
1. Pie Chart\
This pie chart relies on the dataset [Desktop Operating System Market Share Worldwide](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide). 
The data has been already downloaded and stored in `os_combined-ww-monthly-202306-202406.csv`. 
- Controller: `MainVC`, View: `MainView`

2. Bar Chart\
This animated bar chart plots the annual revenues from [Texas Instruments](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TXN/texas-instruments/revenue). 
The downloaded data has been stored in `texas-instruments-revenues.csv`.
- Controller: `BarVC`, View: `BarView`

3. Area Chart\
The animated area chart relies on the dataset `durchschnittssaldo2.csv` which contains the daily balances from a bank account of a specific year. 
- Controller: `AreaVC`, View: `AreaView`

4. Scatter Plot\
The animated scatter plot is based on the [red wine dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). 
After having stored the data in `winequality-red.csv`, the plot is finally plotted using the classes ScatterVC and ScatterView respectively.

5. Heatmap\
This heatmap is a mixture of the javafx package as well as the third party library 
from the CERN institute. It tries to plot the effects of alcohol and pH pH on the wine quality using
the aforementioned red wine dataset.
- Controller: `XYZVC`, View: `XYZView`

6. Line Chart\
The line chart displays the titration of phosphoric acid with sodium hydroxide. 
The data has been generated using [pHCalc](https://github.com/amxyz-cyber/pHCalc)
as a third party library. 
- Controller: `CurveVC`, View: `CurveView`

### Second Part uses the HanSolo library
1. Grid\
The purpose of this plot is to display a simple grid with two axis including the minor ticks. 
- Controller: `HSGridVC`, View: `HSGrid`

2. Coxcom\
This coxcom chart displays the most widely used 'desktop operating systems' dataset mentioned earlier.
- Controller: `HSCoxComVC`, View: `HSCoxComView`

3. Line Chart\
This line chart plots the data generated by `pHCalc`.
- Controller: `HSTitrationVC`, View: `HSTitrationView` 

4. Line Chart\
An alternative line chart that displays the daily balances mentioned above. 
- Controller: `HSBalancesVC`, View: `HSBalancesView` 

5. Time chart\
This time chart uses a time based x-axis to display how often bicycles were 
rented within 24 hours. It relies on the [Ford GoBike dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html).
However, the cleaned dataset can be downloaded from [macrolab](https://github.com/amxyz-cyber/Udacity-DAND-DataVisualization-Ford-GoBike/blob/master/fordgobike.zip).
- Controller: `HSTimeVC`, View: `HSTimeView` 

6. Scatter Plot\
It is an unanimated scatter plot which uses the red wine dataset, too. The x and y
variables are basically the same but with a different look. 
- Controller: `HSWineVC`, `HSWineView` 

7. Bubble Grid Chart\
This bubble grid chart is used for plotting a carnot process. It relies on the
data stored in `carnot-process.csv`.
- Controller: `HSProcessesVC`, View: `HSProcessesView`

8. Parallel Coordinates Chart\
This chart displays the test results from a client/server test whose data has been collected
during tests and stored in `servertests.csv`.
- Controller: `HSServerTestVC`, View: `HSServerTestView`

9. Bar Chart\
Another bar chart which displays the revenues of some multinationals. The data
has been provided by [macrotrends](www.macrotrends.net) and put in `revenues-2023.csv`.
- Controller: `HSRevenueVC`, View: `HSRevenueView`

10. Heatmap\
This heatmap displays the influences of both alcohol and pH on the quality of wine.
- Controller: `HSWineVC`, View: `HSWineView`
